								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/olkdashboard.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>
								<strong>
									Introduction:
								</strong>
								OLK Store, a prominent wholesale supplier specializing in cookies, commissioned a comprehensive
								 analysis to elucidate critical aspects of its business operations. The focus of this analysis
								  was to delineate key performance indicators (KPIs) that encompassed total transactions, total profit,
								   total revenue, total units of cookies sold, and production costs. The project additionally delved into
								    customer segmentation based on the quantity of cookies purchased, with a keen examination of the 
									associated shipping durations.

								Executed as part of an intern project, this analysis undertook meticulous data cleaning and modeling 
								procedures employing advanced tools such as Power Query and Power BI. The utilization of these sophisticated
								 analytical tools ensured a rigorous and insightful examination of OLK Store's operational dynamics, allowing 
								 for a nuanced understanding of various facets crucial to strategic decision-making and business optimization.
								  The outcomes of this project contribute valuable insights for refining business strategies and enhancing 
								  overall performance within the wholesale cookies supply domain.

								<strong>	
									Data Preparation:
								</strong>
								
								<img class="image column" src="images/dataset.png"  alt="" />
								
								
									The raw data, spanning four years and organized into separate Excel sheets, was imported into Power Query using append 
									and merge. 
									The data underwent cleaning to address null values and unwanted figures. Afterward, it was loaded into Power BI
									 for further analysis.
									 <p>
										<strong>
											Total Transactions By Customer:
										</strong>
										<img class="image column" src="images/olkcustomertotaltrans.PNG"  alt="" />
										During the period spanning from 2017 to 2020, the following transactional
										 data was observed for several establishments:
										<ul>
											<strong>
											<h4>
												YT Restaurants:
											</h4>
											</strong>	
											<li>Total Transactions: 670</li>
											<li>Number of Cookies Shipped: 345,614</li>
										</ul>
										<ul>
											<strong>
											<h4>
												Quick Bite Conveniences Store:
											</h4>
											</strong>	
											<li>Total Transactions: 779</li>
											<li>Number of Cookies Shipped: 395,394</li>
										</ul>

										<ul>
											<strong>
											<h4>
												Promo Sales:
											</h4>
											</strong>	
											<li>Total Transactions: 59</li>
											<li>Number of Cookies Shipped: 31,778</li>
										</ul>
										<ul>
											<strong>
											<h4>
												Cascade Grovers:
											</h4>
											</strong>	
											<li>Total Transactions: 918</li>
											<li>Number of Cookies Shipped: 479,965</li>
										</ul>
										<ul>
											<strong>
											<h4>
												Park & Eat LLC:
											</h4>
											</strong>	
											<li>Total Transactions: 597</li>
											<li>Number of Cookies Shipped: 313,113</li>
										</ul>
										<ul>
											<strong>
											<h4>
												Acme Grocery Store:
											</h4>
											</strong>	
											<li>Total Transactions: 208</li>
											<li>Number of Cookies Shipped: 112,358</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									Therefore, the combined total transactions for all establishments over the period of 2017 to 2020 amount to <strong>3,231</strong>
									Total Cookies Shipped from 2017 to 2020: amounts to <strong>1,198,257.</strong>
									<p>
										<strong>
											Customer Segment:
										</strong>
										<img class="image column" src="images/olkpurchasesegment.PNG"  alt="" />
										Establishments demonstrating transactional volumes equal to or exceeding 300 
										were categorized as high-purchasing customers, reflecting a substantial level of engagement and business
										 activity. Conversely, establishments with transactional volumes
										 below 300 were classified as low-purchasing customers, indicating a comparatively moderate 
										 level of business interaction. 
										 This classification framework provides a structured approach to assessing the performance 
										 and purchasing behavior of each customer, facilitating a nuanced understanding of their
										  respective contributions to the overall business landscape.






 									</p>
									 <p>
										<strong>
											Shipments Duration Segment:
										</strong>
										<img class="image column" src="images/olkshipmentduration.PNG"  alt="" />
										The categorization of shipment durations is established based on a discerning criterion: durations equal
										 to or less than 3 are classified as expedited or fast shipments, whereas durations exceeding 3 are designated
										  as standard or slower shipments. This meticulous classification system enables a nuanced evaluation of 
										  shipping efficiency, allowing for a more strategic and informed approach to logistics management.

								<strong>	
									Data Modeling:
								</strong>
								<div>
									<img class="image column" src="images/model.PNG"  alt="" />
								</div>
									A critical step in the process involved the creation of a one-to-many relationship between the fact table and
									 dimension table. This relationship was pivotal for connecting transactional data with relevant dimensions for
									  a comprehensive analysis.
								
								</p>
								
								<p>
									
									<strong>
										Key Findings:
