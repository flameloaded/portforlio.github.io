								<strong>
									Introduction:
								</strong>
									OLK Store, a wholesale cookies retailer, has been experiencing low purchases from two significant
									 customers, Promo and Acme Grocery Store. This diagnostic analysis aims to uncover the root cause of 
									 the low purchase and present key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total transactions, total profit, total 
									 revenue, total number of cookies sold, and production cost. The analysis was conducted as part of an intern
									  project, involving data cleaning and modeling using Power Query and Power BI.
									
									Data Preparation:
									The raw data, spanning four years and organized into separate Excel sheets, was imported into Power Query. 
									The data underwent cleaning to address null values and unwanted figures. Afterward, it was loaded into Power BI
									 for further analysis.
								</p>		
								<p>
								<strong>	
									Data Modeling:
								</strong>
									A critical step in the process involved the creation of a one-to-many relationship between the fact table and
									 dimension table. This relationship was pivotal for connecting transactional data with relevant dimensions for
									  a comprehensive analysis.

								<strong>
									Total Transactions by Customer:
								</strong>

									A cluster bar chart depicted that Acme Grocery Stores and Promo had 49 and 14 transactions, respectively, 
									categorizing them as low-purchasing customers.

								</div>
								<p>
								</strong>
								<strong>
									Total Transactions by Shipping Duration:
								</strong>
									An analysis of shipping duration revealed that all transactions with Promo and Acme Grocery Store experienced
									 delays. This delay may be a contributing factor to the low purchase volumes from these customers.
								</p>
								<p>	
								<strong>
									Recommendation:
								</strong>
									Based on the insights gathered from the dashboard, it is deduced that the low purchase from Promo and 
									Acme Grocery Store could be attributed to delayed shipments. Therefore, it is recommended that OLK Store 
									addresses and improves the efficiency of its shipping processes to enhance customer satisfaction and 
									potentially increase purchases from these clients.
								</p>
								<p>
								<strong>
									Conclusion:
								</strong>
									This diagnostic analysis provides a comprehensive overview of OLK Store's transactional data,
									 identifying specific issues with two key customers. By addressing the highlighted shipping delays,
									  OLK Store can potentially enhance its relationship with Promo and Acme Grocery Store, leading to 
									  increased sales and improved overall performance.
