								<strong>
									Introduction:
								</strong>
								OLK Cookies Industries LTD, a company that produces cookies for human consumption, commissioned a comprehensive
								 analysis to elucidate critical aspects of its business operations. The focus of this analysis
								  was to delineate key performance indicators (KPIs) that encompassed total transactions, Gross profit,
								   total revenue, gross profit margin, and production costs. The project additionally delved into
								    customer segmentation based on the quantity of cookies purchased, with a keen examination of the 
									associated shipping durations.

								Executed as part of an intern project, this analysis undertook meticulous data cleaning and modeling 
								procedures employing advanced tools such as Power Query and Power BI. The utilization of these sophisticated
								 analytical tools ensured a rigorous and insightful examination of OLK Industries operational dynamics, allowing 
								 for a nuanced understanding of various facets crucial to strategic decision-making and business optimization.
								  The outcomes of this project contribute valuable insights for refining business strategies and enhancing 
								  overall performance within the sales of cookies.

										<img class="image column" src="images/olkpurchasesegment.PNG"  alt="" />
										Establishments demonstrating transactional volumes equal to or exceeding 300 
										were categorized as high-purchasing customers, reflecting a substantial level of engagement and business
										 activity. Conversely, establishments with transactional volumes
										 below 300 were classified as low-purchasing customers, indicating a comparatively moderate 
										 level of business interaction. 
										 This classification framework provides a structured approach to assessing the performance 
										 and purchasing behavior of each customer, facilitating a nuanced understanding of their
										  respective contributions to the overall business landscape.






 									</p>
									 <p>
										<strong>

										</strong>
										<img class="image column" src="images/olkshipmentduration.PNG"  alt="" />
										The categorization of shipment durations is established based on a discerning criterion: durations equal
										 to or less than 3 are classified as expedited or fast shipments, whereas durations exceeding 3 are designated
										  as standard or slower shipments. This meticulous classification system enables a nuanced evaluation of 
										  shipping efficiency, allowing for a more strategic and informed approach to logistics management.

									A critical step in the process involved the creation of a one-to-many relationship between the fact table and
									 dimension table. This relationship was pivotal for connecting transactional data with relevant dimensions for
									  a comprehensive analysis.

									<strong>
										Profit Analysis by Year:
									</strong>
								
									<h4>

									</h4>
									
										<img class="image chart" src="images/olkareachart17.PNG" alt="" />
											
										The observed pattern indicates a positive trajectory from the initial quarter through the third quarter,
										followed by a notable and abrupt ascent in the fourth quarter. This distinctive trend highlights the 
										dynamic shifts in performance and a slow growth in the fourth quarter.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>
										<strong>2018:</strong>
									</h4>
									
										<img class="image chart" src="images/olkareachart18.PNG" alt="" />
												
										The area chart illustrates a consistent upward trajectory from the first quarter through 
										the third quarter. Notably, a pronounced and rapid descent in performance is observed in the transition 
										from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. This visual depiction underscores the need for a detailed
										 examination of the factors influencing these trends, providing valuable insights for strategic analysis
										  and decision-making.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>
										<strong>2019:</strong>
									</h4>
									
										<img class="image chart" src="images/olkareachart19.PNG" alt="" />
												
										An analysis of the data reveals a visible downward trend from the first quarter through the third quarter, 
										succeeded by a noteworthy upward trajectory in the fourth quarter. This observed pattern emphasizes the dynamic
										 nature of the data and highlights the importance of exploring the underlying factors contributing to these trends
										  for a comprehensive understanding the rapid change during the specified period.
								</p>		
									
								<p>
									<h4>
										<strong>2020:</strong>
									</h4>
									
										<img class="image chart" src="images/Areachart2.PNG" alt="" />
												
										In the fiscal year 2020, an upward trend was noted from the first quarter to the second quarter, followed by a steep downward 
								trend from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. This analysis of quarterly variations underscores the importance of 
								exploring the underlying factors influencing these trends, providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making and future
								 planning.
								
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>
										<strong>Customer Lifetime Value</strong>
									</h4>
									
										<img class="image chart" src="images/olkclv.PNG" alt="" />
												
										Cascade Grocers (CG) emerges as the leading entity, boasting a figure of $517 million in 2020, followed closely
										 by Quick Bite Convenience Store (QBC) with a respectable value of $430 million. This data underscores CG's
										  prominence as the most valued customer based on Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) analysis, as depicted in the chart.
								
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>
										<strong>Customer Lifetime Value in respect to duration of shipment</strong>
									</h4>
									
										<img class="image chart" src="images/olkclvtrans1.PNG" alt="" />
												
										<img class="image chart" src="images/olkclvtrans2.PNG" alt="" />
										Based on the scatter plot analysis, it is evident that Cascade Grocers exhibits a higher Customer 
										Lifetime Value (CLV) when shipment duration is lower, and conversely, a lower CLV when shipment duration 
										is higher. This observation suggests a clear relationship between shipment duration and business performance.
										 Specifically, it indicates that longer shipment durations may have a detrimental impact on the business's 
										 overall profitability, while shorter durations correlate with higher CLV.

									<strong>
										Recommendation:
									</strong>
								</p>
								<h4>
									Optimization of Shipping Processes:
								</h4>

								Given the impact of shipment duration on customer satisfaction and business performance,
								 it is recommended to conduct a comprehensive review of shipping processes. This may involve
								  streamlining operations to reduce shipping durations, particularly for expedited shipments. 
								  Improved logistics efficiency can contribute to enhanced customer experience and loyalty.
								<h4>
									Strategic Customer Engagement:
								</h4>
									The customer segmentation analysis identified establishments with transactional volumes
									 equal to or exceeding 300 as high-purchasing customers. It is advisable to implement 
									 targeted engagement strategies for these customers, such as personalized offers, loyalty 
									 programs, or exclusive promotions. Strengthening relationships with high-purchasing 
									 customers can have a positive impact on overall business performance.
								<h4>
									Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation:
								</h4>
								The dynamic nature of performance trends, as evident from the yearly analyses, underscores 
								the importance of continuous monitoring and adaptability. OLK Store should establish a proactive
								 approach to monitor market changes, customer behaviors, and internal operations, allowing for 
								 timely adjustments to business strategies.
